# Z E R O
A mod for Mindustry. Nothing special yet... <br>
I hope you like it. 
## Content
Some more or less usefull blocks...
### Side Notes
### 1
This Mod is **NOT** made for mobile devices, so some functions and other stuff maybe don't appear there or let the game *crash*!
### 2
I am not as good as some others, so my Java code is maybe a bit strange. <br><br> Sorry for that!
### 3
I have overridden the `ContentInfoDialog`. Due to the font I used may does not show all Characters correctly, you can disable it under **Settings -> graphics**<br>
*Note: I've added a "filter" for german language, so you shouldn't have problem with german*
### 4
So far, I've disable the visible for the Mod Browser of Mindustry.
## Other
I've added some mod specific settings. You can find them as new points in the normal settings.
